# NinjaRobotV3: Your First Step into Robotics

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the world of robotics! The NinjaRobotV3 is a small, friendly robot that you can build yourself. It's powered by a tiny computer called a Raspberry Pi. This project is designed to be a fun and engaging way to learn the basics of how hardware (like motors and sensors) and software (the code) work together.

**What can the NinjaRobot do?**
- **Move:** It walks and moves its arms using eight different motors.
- **See:** It has a laser "eye" to measure how far away things are.
- **Show Emotions:** It has a screen for a face that can display different expressions.
- **Make Sounds:** A small buzzer lets it beep and play simple tunes.
- **Think:** It has an advanced AI "brain" (powered by Google's Gemini) that lets you control it by talking to it through a web browser on your phone or computer.

By building this robot, you will get a hands-on introduction to electronics, programming, and artificial intelligence, even if you've never written a line of code before!

## 3. Software Installation Guide

Now let's get the robot's brain ready by installing its software. Follow these steps carefully.

#### **Step 1: Install the Operating System**

*   **What to do:** First, you need to install the operating system for your Raspberry Pi. The official "Raspberry Pi Imager" is the easiest way to do this. Download it on your main computer and follow the instructions to flash "Raspberry Pi OS" onto your microSD card.
*   **Why:** The operating system (OS) is the core software that runs the computer. It's like Windows, macOS, or Android, but for your robot.

#### **Step 2: Update the System**

*   **What to do:** Once your Raspberry Pi is booted up and connected to the internet, open the Terminal and type the following command, then press Enter:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```
*   **Why:** This command downloads and installs the latest security updates and software improvements for your robot's OS, just like updating your phone or computer.

#### **Step 3: Enable Hardware Communication**

*   **What to do:** The robot's screen and sensors use special communication channels called SPI and I2C. We need to turn them on. Type this command and press Enter:
    ```bash
    sudo raspi-config
    ```
    Use the arrow keys to navigate the menu:
    1.  Go to `3 Interface Options`.
    2.  Select `I4 SPI` and choose `<Yes>`.
    3.  Select `I5 I2C` and choose `<Yes>`.
    4.  Go to `Finish` to exit.
*   **Why:** This tells the Raspberry Pi's brain to activate the physical ports that the screen (SPI) and distance sensor (I2C) use to talk to it.

#### **Step 4: Install Essential Tools**

*   **What to do:** We need a few more tools. Type this command and press Enter:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install git pigpio -y && curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```
*   **Why:**
    *   `git`: This tool is used to download code from websites like GitHub.
    *   `pigpio`: This is a special library that is very good at controlling the robot's motors precisely.
    *   `uv`: This is a fast, modern tool we will use to manage all the Python software components of the robot.

#### **Step 5: Start the Motor Control Service**

*   **What to do:** Now we need to start the `pigpio` service we just installed.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start pigpiod && sudo systemctl enable pigpiod
    ```
*   **Why:** This starts the motor control service and, importantly, tells the robot to start it automatically every time it boots up.

#### **Step 6: Download the NinjaRobot Code**

*   **What to do:** It's time to download the robot's project files.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nilcreator/NinjaRobotV3.git
    cd NinjaRobotV3
    ```
*   **Why:** The first command uses `git` to copy the entire NinjaRobotV3 project from GitHub to your Raspberry Pi. The second command moves you inside the project folder you just downloaded.

#### **Step 7: Install the Robot's Python Libraries**

*   **What to do:** This is the final software installation step. Make sure you are in the `NinjaRobotV3` directory and run this command:
    ```bash
    source /home/rogerchang/.cargo/env && uv pip install -e ./pi0ninja_v3 -e ./piservo0 -e ./pi0disp -e ./vl53l0x_pigpio -e ./pi0buzzer
    ```
*   **Why:** This command uses `uv` to install all the different software drivers for the robot's parts (the main controller, servos, display, sensor, and buzzer). The `-e` flag installs them in "editable" mode, which means if you decide to change the code later, your changes will be used immediately.

## 4. User Guide: Testing Your Robot

After assembly and software installation, it's a good idea to test each part to make sure everything is working correctly. Run these commands from the `NinjaRobotV3` directory in your terminal.

#### **Test 1: The Buzzer (Voice Box)**

*   **What to do:** Let's test the buzzer. This command tells the robot that the buzzer is on pin 26.
    ```bash
    uv run pi0buzzer init 26
    ```
*   **What to expect:** You should hear a short "Hello World" sound. If you do, it's working!

#### **Test 2: The Display (Face)**

*   **What to do:** Now for the face. This command runs a performance test.
    ```bash
    uv run pi0disp test
    ```
*   **What to expect:** You should see animated, colorful balls bouncing around on the screen. If you see them, your display is working! Press `Ctrl` + `C` on your keyboard to stop the test.

#### **Test 3: The Distance Sensor (Eyes)**

*   **What to do:** Time to test the eyes. This command will take 10 distance measurements.
    ```bash
    uv run vl53l0x_pigpio get
    ```
*   **What to expect:** The terminal will print out distance readings in millimeters. Try putting your hand in front of the sensor and see the numbers change.

#### **Test 4: The Servos (Muscles)**

*   **What to do:** Let's test one of the leg motors. This command tells the servo on pin 17 (the left leg) to move to the 0-degree (center) position.
    ```bash
    uv run piservo0 servo 17 0
    ```
*   **What to expect:** You should see the left leg servo move. You can test the other servos by changing the pin number and the angle. For example, to test the right leg (pin 27) and move it to 45 degrees, you would run:
    ```bash
    uv run piservo0 servo 27 45
    ```
    Refer to the hardware table to get the pin number for each servo.

**Congratulations!** If all the tests worked, your NinjaRobot is fully built and ready for action. To learn how to start the main web control interface and talk to your robot's AI, please read the **`NinjaUserGuide.md`**.
